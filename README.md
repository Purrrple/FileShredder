# FileShredder
Corrupt your school projects so that you don't have to hand them in!

HOW TO USE THIS SIMPLE THING (IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF :D)
1. Download the file
2. Open FileShredder.exe
3. Press "Corrupt Files"
4. Press "Browse" and select the file you want to corrupt
5. Press "Open"
6. You can now view the file's contents or corrupt it by pressing "View Contents" or "Corrupt File"
7. Try to open it in it's corresponding program (Microsoft Word for .docx and PowerPoint for .pptx and so on)

This shredder works on almost anything thats not plain text (.txt from Notepad for example).

Press the help button in the program for more semi-sarcastic remarks and explinations!
